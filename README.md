Setup:

- Set up your GitHub account
- Clone the repos MQ-Test to your computer from GitHub
- Create a new branch named ur name (lets say my name is jasper) -> "git checkout -b jasper" in terminal
- Use "git branch" to check you are in the correct branch

Running/Pushing the Project:

- Use "git branch" to make sure you're in your branch (your name should be green after running this command)
- Do what u want to the file
  - I'm hoping you all know how to run java files (make sure to use "javac [filename].java" before you use "java [filename]" in terminal!!)
- After u finish:
  - "git status" -> shows your modified file(s)
  - "git add ." -> sets up ALL your modified files to be committed
  - "git commit -m "a useful message"" -> commit/save/set-checkpoint with your current changes (like saving)
  - "git push origin jasper" -> push/save ur changes to GitHub
